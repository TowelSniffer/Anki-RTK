NOTE: Current release of android does not officially support JQuery. the result is the popup information for kanji won't work on ankidroid. This will be fixed in a future update however I am currently using this release AnkiDroid 2.15alpha26 and it works well. in the future, this will no longer be an issue so check your current version first.
